# Jeron Perey’s Personal Website
This is a personal website built using the Hack4Impact Starter Pack!  
It serves as my digital portfolio — showcasing my projects, experiences, and interests in computer science, community mentorship, and technology-driven impact.  
Here you’ll find my work, contact info, and updates as I continue building meaningful software.
