                <p>In my physics project on the 2-D Ising Model, our team initially clashed over how to structure the temperature sweep — one person wanted to write a separate script for each run, while I pushed for a single parameterized function.</p>

                <p>Instead of debating endlessly, I suggested we test both approaches. The result was clear: the modular, function-based structure was not only faster but far easier to debug and extend. That small experiment taught me that effective collaboration often means <strong>turning opinions into data</strong>.</p>

                <p>At the same time, I was mentoring high school students through the <strong>Silicon Valley Education Foundation (SVEF)</strong>. Leading those sessions reinforced that good communication and empathy are as vital as technical skill.</p>

                <p>Whether in a research group or a mentorship role, I've learned that leadership is less about giving orders and more about creating an environment where everyone's ideas can be tested and validated.</p>

                <p>That experience now shapes how I approach team projects — balancing structure with open collaboration, and logic with empathy.</p>

                <h2>Key Leadership Principles</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data-driven decisions</strong> over personal preferences</li>
                    <li><strong>Empathy and communication</strong> are as important as technical skills</li>
                    <li><strong>Creating safe spaces</strong> for idea testing and validation</li>
                    <li><strong>Balancing structure</strong> with open collaboration</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Mentorship Experience</h2>
                <p>Through SVEF, I taught math and computer science to over 100 students across multiple districts. This experience taught me that effective teaching isn't just about explaining concepts — it's about understanding each student's learning style and adapting your approach accordingly.</p>

                </blockquote>

                <h2>Technical Collaboration</h2>
                <p>In technical projects, I've learned that the best solutions often emerge from combining different perspectives. The key is creating a process where ideas can be tested objectively rather than debated subjectively.</p>
